#### Residual noise/deviation from the population mean

The **residual noise** in a probabilistic model $p(Y)$,
also known as the 
**residual deviation of an observation from its population mean**
or **residual** for short,
is the difference between an observed value $y$ and its population mean:

$$\devn(y) \eqdef y - \Expf{Y}$$ {#eq-def-resid}
:::

:::{.notes}
We use the same notation for residual noise that we used for [errors](estimation.qmd#def-error).

$\Expf{Y}$ can be viewed as an estimate of $Y$, before $y$ is observed.
Conversely, each observation $y$ can be viewed as an estimate of $\Expf{Y}$
(albeit an imprecise one, individually, since $n=1$).

:::

We can rearrange @eq-def-resid
to view $y$ as
the sum of its mean plus the residual noise:

$$y = \Exp{Y} + \epsf{y}$$
