::: notes
It is typically easier to work with the log of the likelihood function:

:::{#thm-mle-use-log}

The likelihood and log-likelihood have the same maximizer:

$$
\am_\th \Lik(\th) = \am_\th \lik(\th)
$$

For $\iid$ data, we will have a much easier time taking the derivative of the log-likelihood:

#### Derivative of the log-likelihood function for $\iid$ data

For $\iid$ data:

$$\ell'(\theta) = \sumin \deriv{\theta} \log{\p(X=x_i|\theta)}$$ {#eq-deriv-llik}

:::

:::{.proof}
$$
\ba
\lik'(\th)
&= \deriv{\th} \lik(\th)
\\ &= \deriv{\th} \sum_{i=1}^n \log{\p(X=x_i|\theta)}
\\ &= \sum_{i=1}^n \deriv{\th} \log{\p(X=x_i|\theta)}
\ea
$$
