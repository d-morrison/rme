R provides a rich ecosystem of packages for survival analysis,
ranging from core functionality to specialized visualization tools and advanced modeling capabilities.

#### Visualization Packages

##### ggsurvfit

**[`ggsurvfit`](https://danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/)** is a modern package for creating publication-ready survival plots using ggplot2.

- Developed by [Daniel D. Sjoberg](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/) and collaborators
- Seamlessly integrates with ggplot2,
allowing full customization using familiar ggplot2 syntax
- Key features:
  - Create Kaplan-Meier plots with `ggsurvfit()`
  - Add confidence intervals with `add_confidence_interval()`
  - Add risk tables with `add_risktable()`
  - Add quantile annotations with `add_quantile()`
  - Support for competing risks with `ggcuminc()`
- Produces publication-ready legends without showing raw variable names
- All plot elements are native ggplot2 layers,
making customization straightforward
- Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsurvfit/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/ggsurvfit)

##### survminer

**[`survminer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html)** is another popular visualization package for survival analysis.

- Creates ggplot2-based survival plots using `ggsurvplot()`
- Provides functions for visualizing Cox model results
- Includes tools for testing proportional hazards assumptions
- Offers built-in themes and color palettes for publication-quality plots
- Can display risk tables, cumulative events, and censoring counts

##### ggfortify

**[`ggfortify`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggfortify/index.html)** extends ggplot2 with automatic plotting capabilities.

- Provides `autoplot()` method for `survfit` objects (demonstrated in the plotting example above)
- One-line code to create survival curves with confidence intervals
- Automatically handles grouping variables and creates legends
- Shows censoring marks on plots by default
- Returns ggplot2 objects for further customization
- Also supports many other statistical objects beyond survival analysis

#### Additional Modeling Packages

Several packages extend the modeling capabilities beyond the core `survival` package:

- **[`flexsurv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexsurv/index.html)**: Flexible parametric survival models with a wide range of distributions
- **[`rms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rms/index.html)** (Regression Modeling Strategies): 
Advanced regression modeling including survival models with tools for model validation and calibration
- **[`cmprsk`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cmprsk/index.html)**: Competing risks regression using the Fine-Gray model
- **[`mstate`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mstate/index.html)**: Multi-state survival models for complex event histories
- **[`timereg`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/timereg/index.html)**: Flexible regression models for survival data,
including additive hazards models
- **[`frailtypack`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/frailtypack/index.html)**: Frailty models for clustered or recurrent event data
- **[`riskRegression`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/riskRegression/index.html)**: Risk prediction models and performance evaluation
- **[`pec`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pec/index.html)**: Prediction error curves for survival model validation
- **[`prodlim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prodlim/index.html)**: Fast estimation of survival models including competing risks

#### Package Selection Guidance

For most standard survival analyses:

- Use **`survival`** for core functionality (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models, parametric models)
- Choose **`ggsurvfit`** for modern,
customizable survival plots if you're familiar with ggplot2
- Consider **`survminer`** as an alternative visualization package with many built-in features
- Use **`ggfortify`** if you want quick,
automatic plots with minimal code

For specialized analyses:

- **Competing risks**: `cmprsk` or `riskRegression`
- **Multi-state models**: `mstate`
- **Flexible parametric models**: `flexsurv`
- **Clustered/recurrent events**: `frailtypack`
- **Model validation**: `rms` or `pec`

The [CRAN Survival Analysis Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html) provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date list of available packages.
