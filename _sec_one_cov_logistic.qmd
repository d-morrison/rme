::: notes

* In @exm-oc-mi, we estimated the risk and the odds of MI for two groups,
defined by oral contraceptive use.

* If the predictor is quantitative (dose) or there is more than one predictor, the task becomes more difficult.

* In this case, we will use logistic regression, which is a generalization of the linear regression models you have been using that can account for a binary response instead of a continuous one.

### Independent binary outcomes - general  {.smaller}

For a data set of mutually independent binary outcomes $\vy  = (y_1, ..., y_n)$:

:::{#exr-bernoulli-likelihood-general}

Write the likelihood of the data set.

### Modeling $\pi_i$ as a function of $X_i$

If there are only a few distinct $X_i$ values, we can model $\pi_i$
separately for each value of $X_i$.

Otherwise, we need regression.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi(x) &\equiv \text{E}(Y=1|X=x)\\
&= f(x^\top\beta)
\end{aligned}
$$

Typically, we use the $\expit$ inverse-link:

$$\pi(\vec x) = \expit(\vx'\beta)$${#eq-logistic-link}

### Three parts to regression models

-   What distribution does the outcome have for a specific subpopulation
defined by covariates? (outcome model)

-   How does the combination of covariates relate to the mean? (link
function)

-   How do the covariates combine? (linear predictor, interactions)
