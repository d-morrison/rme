* In @exm-oc-mi, we estimated the risk and the odds of MI for two groups,
defined by oral contraceptive use.

* If the predictor is quantitative (dose) or there is more than one predictor, the task becomes more difficult.

* In this case, we will use logistic regression, which is a generalization of the linear regression models you have been using that can account for a binary response instead of a continuous one.

### Binary outcomes models - one group, no covariates {.smaller}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\P(Y=1) &= \pi\\
\P(Y=0) &= 1-\pi\\
\P(Y=y) &= \pi^y (1-\pi)^{1-y}\\
\mathbf y  &= (y_1, ..., y_n)\\
\Lik(\pi;\mathbf y) &= \pi^{\sum y_i} (1-\pi)^{n - \sum y_i}\\
\ell(\pi, \mathbf y) &= \left({\sum y_i}\right) \logf{\pi} + \left(n - \sum y_i\right) \logf{1-\pi}\\
&= \left({\sum y_i}\right) \left(\logf{\pi} - \logf{1-\pi}\right) + n \cdot \logf{1-\pi}\\
&= \left({\sum y_i}\right) \logf{\frac{\pi}{ 1-\pi}} + n \cdot \logf{1-\pi}
\\ &= \left({\sum y_i}\right) \logit(\pi) + n \cdot \logf{1-\pi}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Binary outcomes - general  {.smaller}

$$
\ba
\P(Y_i=1) &= \pi_i
\\ \P(Y_i=0) &= 1-\pi_i
\ea
$$

$$\P(Y_i=y_i) = (\pi_i)^y_i (1-\pi_i)^{1-y_i}$$

$$\Lik_i(\pi_i) = \P(Y_i=y_i)$$

$$
\ba
\ell_i(\pi_i)
   &= \logf{\Lik_i(\pi_i)}
\\ &= y_i \logf{\pi_i} + (1-y_i) \logf{1-\pi_i}
\ea
$$

---

For $\iid$ data $\vec y  = (y_1, ..., y_n)$:

$$
\ba
\Lik(\pi;\vec y) &= \P(\dsvn{Y}{y})
\\ &= \prod_{i=1}^n \P(Y_i=y_i)
\\ &= \prod_{i=1}^n \Lik_i(\pi_i)
\ea
$$

### Modeling $\pi_i$ as a function of $X_i$

If there are only a few distinct $X_i$ values, we can model $\pi_i$
separately for each value of $X_i$.

Otherwise, we need regression.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi(x) &\equiv \text{E}(Y=1|X=x)\\
&= f(x^\top\beta)
\end{aligned}
$$

Typically, we use the $\expit$ inverse-link:

$$\pi(\vec x) = \expit(\vx'\beta)$${#eq-logistic-link}

### Three parts to regression models

-   What distribution does the outcome have for a specific subpopulation
defined by covariates? (outcome model)

-   How does the combination of covariates relate to the mean? (link
function)

-   How do the covariates combine? (linear predictor, interactions)

library(parameters)

Fitted values:

```{r}

predict(beetles_glm_grouped, type = "link")

fit_y <- beetles$n * fitted.values(beetles_glm_grouped)

::: notes
They seem the same! But not quite:
:::

```{r}
logLik(beetles_glm_grouped)
logLik(beetles_glm_ungrouped)
```

::: notes
The difference is due to the binomial coefficient
$\left(n\atop x \right)$ which isn't included in the
individual-observations (Bernoulli) version of the model.
