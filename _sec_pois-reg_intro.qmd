::: notes
This chapter presents models for
[count data](probability.qmd#sec-count-vars) outcomes.
With covariates,
the event rate $\lambda$
becomes a function of the covariates
$\vX = (X_1, \dots,X_n)$.
Typically, count data models use
a $\logf{}$ link function,
and thus an $\exp{}$ inverse-link function.
That is:
:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Expp[Y | \vX = \vx, T = t] &= \mu(\vx,t)
\\ \mu(\vx,t) &= \lambda(\vx)\cdot t
\\ \lambda(\vx) &= \exp{\eta(\vx)}
\\ \eta(\vx) &= \vx'\tilde \beta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-mean-poisson}

::: notes
$T=t$ is called the *exposure magnitude* (@def-exposure)
and has a special role in this model.

Where have we seen a relationship like
$$\mu = \lambda \cdot t$$
before?
:::

---

:::{#sol-analogy-pois-offset-binom}
The relationship
$$\mu = \lambda \cdot t$$
in count regression models
is analogous to the relationship
$$\mu = n \pi$$
in Binomial models.

::: notes
We can also think of $t$ as a special part of the linear component:
:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\logf{\Expp[Y | \vX = \vx,T=t]}
&= \logf{\mu(\vx)}\\
&=\logf{\lambda(\vx) \cdot t}\\
&=\logf{\lambda(\vx)} + \log{t}\\
&=\logf{\exp{\eta(\vx)}} + \log{t}\\
&=\eta(\vx) + \log{t}\\
&=\vx'\tilde\beta + \log{t}\\
&=(\beta_0 +\beta_1 x_1+\dots + \beta_p x_p) + \log{t}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

::: notes
In contrast with the other covariates (represented by $\vX$),
$t$ enters this expression with a $\log{}$ transformation
and without a corresponding $\beta$ coefficient;
in other words, $\logf{t}$ is an **offset term** (@def-offset).

What are the units of $\mu$ in @eq-mean-poisson?
:::

---

:::{#sol-eq-mean-poisson}

$\mu$ is the mean of $Y$,
and $Y$ is a count,
so $\mu$ is also a count;
for example:

- 3.1 cyclones,
- 10.23 ER visits
- 15.01 infections

:::

:::{#exr-eq-rate-poisson}
What are the units of $\lambda$ in @eq-mean-poisson?
:::

---

:::{#sol-eq-rate-poisson}
$\lambda = \mu/t$,
so $\lambda$ is a rate of counts per unit of $t$.
For example:

- 3.1 cyclones *per year*
- 2.023 ER visits per 10 person-years
- 15.01 infections per 1000 person-years at risk
