If you want to report risk differences or risk ratios instead of odds ratios,
you can obtain estimates from logistic regression models,
as long as you didn't stratify sampling by the outcome;
in other words, not in case-control studies
(see @sec-CC-studies).

To compute risk ratios from logistic regression models:

- Apply the expit function to the linear predictor for each covariate pattern
to compute the (estimated) risks,
- Then take the differences or ratios of the risks, as needed.

To quantify uncertainty for risk difference or risk ratio estimates
derived from logistic regression models
(e.g., to calculate SEs, CIs, and p-values),
you will need to use the
bootstrap,
the multivariate delta method,
or some other special technique.
