# Causal Inference

Statistical models can only tell us about differences in real-world distributions.
But causal inference is about comparisons between potential-world distributions.

![An illustrative example](correlation-causation.png){#fig-cor-caus-death}

@fig-cor-caus-death is a bit misleading;
there isn't even a correlation between (confusing correlation and causation) and dying.
This (and the usual milk-criminal example) are both more about predictive accuracy and lack of specificity.

No causes in, no causes out.

## Common Biases in Epidemiologic Research

Understanding and avoiding bias is fundamental to drawing valid causal conclusions from epidemiologic studies.
The [Catalog of Bias](https://catalogofbias.org/) provides a comprehensive resource for learning about various types of bias that can affect health research.
This collaborative project, led by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford,
defines, explains, and provides examples of research biases.

### Collider Bias {#sec-collider-bias}

**Collider bias** (also called **collider stratification bias** or **selection on a collider**)
is a type of bias that occurs when an analysis inappropriately controls for, conditions on, or restricts the sample to a variable that is influenced by both the exposure and the outcome being studied.

#### What is a Collider?

A **collider** is a variable that is caused by (or influenced by) both the exposure and the outcome of interest.
In causal diagrams (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), a collider appears as a variable where arrows from both the exposure and outcome point into it.

For example:

- Exposure → Collider ← Outcome

#### How Collider Bias Occurs

Controlling for or selecting based on a collider can:

- Create a spurious association between the exposure and outcome when none exists
- Distort or mask an existing association
- Lead to misleading conclusions about causal relationships

This is distinct from **confounding**, where a third variable influences both the exposure and the outcome.
With colliders, the problematic variable is a *consequence*, not a cause, of both exposure and outcome.

#### Classic Examples

1. **Hospital Admission Bias**:
When studying the relationship between two diseases using only hospitalized patients,
hospitalization itself becomes a collider (both diseases increase the likelihood of hospitalization).
This can create false associations between diseases that don't exist in the general population.

2. **The Obesity Paradox**:
Some studies restricted to patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) have found that obese patients appear to have lower mortality than non-obese patients—a reversed association compared to the general population.
This can result from collider bias:
both obesity and other risk factors increase the likelihood of developing CVD,
and restricting analysis to those with CVD induces spurious associations.

3. **Birth Weight Paradox**:
Studies of infant mortality restricted to low birth weight infants can show paradoxical protective effects of maternal smoking,
because birth weight is a collider affected by both smoking and other causes of low birth weight.

#### How to Avoid Collider Bias

- Use causal diagrams (DAGs) to visualize potential colliders in your study design
- Carefully consider which variables to control for—controlling for colliders introduces bias
- Avoid restricting your sample based on variables affected by both exposure and outcome
- When possible, analyze the full population rather than selected subgroups

## Relationship to Model Building

When building regression models, it's important to think carefully about which covariates to include.
Adding a collider as a covariate can introduce bias rather than reduce it.
This is why subject matter knowledge and causal reasoning,
not just statistical considerations,
should guide variable selection in causal analyses.
