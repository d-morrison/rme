### Other Parametric Survival Distributions

-   Any density on $[0,\infty)$ can be a survival distribution, but the
most useful ones are all skew right.
-   The most frequently used generalization of the exponential is the [Weibull](probability.qmd#sec-weibull).
-   Other common choices are the gamma, log-normal, log-logistic,
Gompertz, inverse Gaussian, and Pareto.
-   Most of what we do going forward is non-parametric or
semi-parametric, but sometimes these parametric distributions
provide a useful approach.
