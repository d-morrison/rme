# GitHub Copilot Setup Steps for RME (Regression Models for Epidemiology)
#
# This workflow configures the GitHub Copilot coding agent's environment
# by preinstalling R, Quarto, TinyTeX, JAGS, and all required dependencies.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
#
# This workflow aligns with setup requirements:
# - R version (as specified in DESCRIPTION)
# - Quarto CLI for rendering the website
# - TinyTeX for PDF output
# - JAGS for Bayesian analysis
# - All package dependencies managed via renv

name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation,
# and allow manual testing through the repository's "Actions" tab
