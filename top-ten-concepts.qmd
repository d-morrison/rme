# Summary of Regression Modeling Concepts

## We use different probability models for different data types

* Binary outcomes: Bernoulli models
* Event rate outcomes: Poisson/Negative binomial models
* Time-to-event outcomes: Survival models
* Catch-all: Gaussian models

## We use different link functions to connect these models with covariates

* Bernoulli models: logit link
* Count models: log link + offset
* Survival models: log link
* Gaussian models: identity link

@fig-model-diagrams sketches how the various models we have studied
have analogous structures.
To do: convert this sketch into a nicely formatted figure.

## We use maximum likelihood estimation to fit models to data

* likelihood
* log-likelihood
* score function
* hessian

## We use asymptotic normality of MLEs to quantify uncertainty about models

* observed information matrix
* expected information matrix
* standard error
* confidence intervals
* p-values

## We use (log) likelihood ratios to compare models

Sometimes we adjust these comparisons for model size (AIC, BIC)
