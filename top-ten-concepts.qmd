# We use different probability models for different data types

* Binary outcomes: Bernoulli models
* Event rate outcomes: Poisson/Negative binomial models
* Time-to-event outcomes: Survival models
* Catch-all: Gaussian models

# We use different link functions to connect these models with covariates

* Bernoulli models: logit link
* Count models: log link + offset
* Survival models: log link
* Gaussian models: identity link

# We use maximum likelihood estimation to fit models to data

* likelihood
* log-likelihood
* score function
* observed information matrix
* expected information matrix
* standard error
* confidence intervals
* p-values

# We use (log) likelihood ratios to compare models

Sometimes we adjust these comparisons for model size (AIC, BIC)
