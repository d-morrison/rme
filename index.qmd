# Preface {.unnumbered}

This web-book is derived from my lecture slides for Epidemiology 204: "Quantitative Epidemiology III: Statistical Models", at UC Davis.

I have drawn these materials from many sources, including but not limited to:

- [David Rocke](https://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/)'s materials from the [2021 edition of this course ](https://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/Class/EPI204-Spring-2021/EPI204-Spring-2021.html)

- [Hua Zhou](https://hua-zhou.github.io/)'s materials from the [2020 edition of Biostat 200C at UCLA](https://ucla-biostat-200c-2020spring.github.io/schedule/schedule.html)

## Using these lecture notes {.unnumbered}

This website provides lecture notes for Epidemiology 204: Quantitative Epidemiology III (Statistical Models) at UC Davis.

The notes are available online at <https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/> and are searchable and continuously updated^[see the source file repository for recent changes: <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme>].

### Multiple Format Options {.unnumbered}

Each chapter is available in three formats:

1. **HTML (Website)**: Browse chapters online with navigation and search
2. **RevealJS Slides**: Presentation slides for teaching (e.g., `logistic-regression-slides.html`)
3. **PDF Handouts**: Printable documents for each chapter (e.g., `logistic-regression-handout.pdf`)

### Compiling chapters locally {.unnumbered}

To compile chapters from source:

1. [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

2. Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d-morrison/rme.git
cd rme
```

3. Install R package dependencies:

``` r 
library(devtools)
devtools::install_deps()
```

4. Render in your desired format:

**HTML website:**
``` bash
quarto render --profile=website
```

**RevealJS slides:**
``` bash
quarto render logistic-regression.qmd --profile=revealjs
# Or render all slides:
quarto render --profile=revealjs
```

**PDF handouts:**
``` bash
quarto render logistic-regression.qmd --profile=handout
# Or render all handouts:
quarto render --profile=handout
```

### Extracting LaTeX commands from the online version of the notes {.unnumbered}

If you want to extract the LaTeX commands for any math expressions in the online lecture notes, you should be able to right-click and get this pop-up menu:

![Pop-up menu produced by right-clicking on math in online notes](images/latex-popup-1.png){#fig-right-click-math}

If you select "TeX commands", you will get a window with LaTeX code.^[[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is more or less a dialect of LaTeX]

![LaTeX source code window](images/latex-popup-2.png){#fig-LaTeX-source-code-popup}

You can also grab the TeX commands from the quarto source files on github, but those files use custom macros (defined in <https://github.com/d-morrison/rme/blob/main/macros.qmd>), so it's a little harder to reuse code from the source files.

### Dark Mode {.unnumbered}

The online notes have two color palette themes: light and dark.
You can toggle between them using the oval button near the top-left corner:

## Other resources {.unnumbered}

These notes represent my still-developing perspective on regression models in epidemiology. 
Many other statisticians and epidemiologists have published their own perspectives, 
and I encourage you to explore your many options and find ones that resonate with you. 
I have attempted to cite my sources throughout these notes. 

Here are some additional resources that I've come across; 
I haven't had time to read some of them
thoroughly yet, but they're all on my to-do list. 
I'll add my thoughts on them over time.
