### Confidence intervals for regression coefficients and rate ratios

As usual:

$$
\beta \in \left[\ci \right]
$$

Rate ratios: exponentiate CI endpoints

$$
\exp{\beta} \in \left[\exp{\ci} \right]
$$

### Hypothesis tests for regression coefficients

$$
z = \frac{\hat \beta - \beta_0}{\hse{\hb}}
$$

Compare $z$ or $|z|$ to the tails of the standard Gaussian distribution, according to the null hypothesis.

### Comparing nested models

log(likelihood ratio) tests, as usual.
