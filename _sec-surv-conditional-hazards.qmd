#### conditional hazard

The **conditional hazard** of outcome $T$ at value $t$,
given covariate vector $\vx$,
is the conditional density of the event $T=t$,
given $T \ge t$ and $\vX = \vx$:

#### baseline hazard

:::: notes
The **baseline hazard**, **base hazard**, or **reference hazard**,
denoted $h_0(t)$ or $\lambda_0(t)$,
is the [hazard function](intro-to-survival-analysis.qmd#def-hazard)
for the subpopulation of individuals
whose covariates are all equal to their reference levels:

::: notes
The baseline hazard is *somewhat* analogous to
the intercept term in linear regression,
but it is **not** a mean.

:::{#def-baseline-surv}
#### Baseline survival function

The **baseline survival function**
is the survival function
for an individual whose covariates
are all equal to their default values.

$$S_0(t) \eqdef \surv(t | \vX = \vzero)$$

::: notes
Now, let's define ***how*** the hazard function depends on covariates.
We typically use a log link to model the relationship between
the hazard function, $\haz(t|\vx)$, and
the linear component, $\eta(t|\vx)$,
as we did for Poisson models in @sec-count-reg;
that is:

::: note
In contrast with Poisson regression,
here $\loghaz(t|\vx)$ depends on **both** $t$ **and** $\vx$.
