There are two predominant paradigms for statistical inference:

1. Bayesian inference (@sec-bayes)
2. Frequentist inference (@sec-intro-MLEs)

## Interpretation of Negative Findings

If an estimation interval includes the null hypothesis,
or equivalently if a hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis,
that doesn't *necessarily* mean that the null hypothesis is true.
Accordingly, 
we should not write interpretations of results as 
"the odds (or risks/hazards/means) are not significantly different"; 
instead, we should write something like 
"the data does not provide statistically significant EVIDENCE 
that the odds (or analogous estimands) differ". 
Statistical significance is a characteristic of evidence, not of the estimands.

P-values do not distinguish between absence of evidence and evidence of absence.

Confidence intervals do: 
if the confidence interval is narrow and includes the null value,
then that confidence interval represents evidence of absence.
If a confidence interval includes the null value but also includes 
substantially non-null values, 
then that confidence interval represents absence of evidence.

Also, even if we do have statistically significant evidence of a non-null value,
the estimated value may not be **substantially different from 0**,
depending on what estimand is.
For example, we might have statistically significant evidence that
a certain exercise prolongs human lifespans by 20 seconds,
but that effect would probably not be substantially different from 0
in practical terms.

@fig-CI-interp sketches various scenarios for confidence intervals,
from office hours.
To do: convert this sketch into a nicely formatted figure.

#### margin of error
The **margin of error** (a.k.a. the **radius**) is 
one-half the width of a confidence interval.
