What odds value corresponds to the probability $\pi = 0.2$,
and what is the numerical difference between these two values?

$$
\odds = \frac{\pi}{1-\pi}
=\frac{.2}{.8}
= .25

Find the difference between
an odds $\omega$ and its corresponding probability $\pi$,
as a function of $\pi$.

$$
\ba
\odds - \pi
&= \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} - \pi
\\ &= \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} - \frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{1-\pi}
\\ &= \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} - \frac{\pi - \pi^2}{1-\pi}
\\ &= \frac{\pi - (\pi - \pi^2)}{1-\pi}
\\ &= \frac{\pi - \pi + \pi^2}{1-\pi}
\\ &= \frac{\pi^2}{1-\pi}
\\ &= \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} \pi
\\ &= \odds \pi

Let $\odds = \frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$. Then:

$$\odds - \pi = \frac{\pi^2}{1-\pi}$$

::: proof
By @sol-odds-minus-probs.

::: notes

For rare events (small $\pi$),
odds and probabilities are nearly equal, because $1-\pi \approx 1$ (see @fig-odds-probs).

For example, in @exm-odds, the probability and odds differ by $`r abs(pi_OC - odds_OC)`$.
