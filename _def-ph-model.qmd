::: notes
As the second generalization,
we let the
base hazard,
cumulative hazard, and
survival functions
depend on $t$,
but not on any covariates (for now).
We can do this using either parametric
or semi-parametric approaches.

#### Proportional hazards model

A **proportional hazards** model for a time-to-event outcome $T$ is a model where the log-hazard has the following form:

$$
\ba
\loghaz(t|\vx) &= \loghaz_0(t) + \reglincomb
\\
&= \loghaz_0(t) + \regbetasum
\ea
$${#eq-ph-lincomp}

::: notes
In a proportional hazards model, the intercept term $\loghaz_0(t)$ depends on time $t$.
