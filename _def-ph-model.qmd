::: notes
As the second generalization,
we let the
base hazard,
cumulative hazard, and
survival functions
depend on $t$,
but not on any covariates (for now).
We can do this using either parametric
or semi-parametric approaches.

#### Proportional hazards model

A **proportional hazards** model for a time-to-event outcome $T$ is a model where the difference in log-hazard from the baseline log-hazard is equal to a linear combination of the predictors:

$$\diffloghaz(t|\vx) = \reglincomb$${#eq-ph-diffloghaz}

:::

---

Equivalently:

:::{#lem-ph-lincomp}

In a proportional hazards model (that is, if @eq-ph-diffloghaz holds):

$$
\ba
\loghaz(t|\vx) &= \loghaz_0(t) + \reglincomb
\\
&= \loghaz_0(t) + \regbetasum
\ea
$${#eq-ph-lincomp}

::: notes
In a proportional hazards model, 
the baseline log-hazard is analogous to the intercept term in a generalized linear model, 
except that the baseline log-hazard depends on time, $t$.
