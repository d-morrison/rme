::: notes

Now that we have defined odds, we can introduce another way of comparing event probabilities: odds ratios.

There's a 1:1 mapping between probability and odds, 
and according to that mapping, 
the odds are equal between two covariate patterns 
IF and ONLY IF the probabilities are also equal between those patterns. 
So, 
testing whether an odds ratio = 1 is equivalent to 
testing whether the corresponding risk ratio = 1, 
and also equivalent to 
testing whether the risk difference = 0.
