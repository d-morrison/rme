::: notes

Now that we have defined odds, we can introduce another way of comparing event probabilities: odds ratios.

There's a 1:1 mapping between probability and odds, 
and according to that mapping, 
the odds are equal between two covariate patterns 
IF and ONLY IF the probabilities are also equal between those patterns. 
So, 
testing whether an odds ratio = 1 is equivalent to 
testing whether the corresponding risk ratio = 1, 
and also equivalent to 
testing whether the risk difference = 0.
Therefore, 
in **hypothesis testing**, 
if the null hypothesis is no effect, 
then we can shift between RD, RR, and OR.
But when we're talking about **point estimates** and **CIs**, 
we need to limit our conclusions to the effect measure(s) that we actually estimated, 
because the *sizes* of RDs, RRs, and ORs don't have a simple relationship to each other, 
except when pi_1=pi_2 (as shown by @fig-rd-rr-or).
