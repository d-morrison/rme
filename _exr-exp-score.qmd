Derive the score function for a single exponential random variable $X$,
with respect to the mean parameter $\pmean$.

::::{#sol-exp-score-fn}

The score function is the first derivative of the log-likelihood:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\score &\eqdef
\deriv{\pmean}\loglik
\\
&=\deriv{\pmean}\paren{\llexpmean}
\\
&=\deriv{\pmean}\paren{-\logf{\pmean}} -\deriv{\pmean} \frac{x}{\pmean}
\\
&=-\frac{1}{\pmean} + \frac{x}{\pmean^2}
\\
&=-\frac{\pmean}{\pmean^2} + \frac{x}{\pmean^2}
\\
&=\frac{x - \pmean}{\pmean^2}
\\
&= \scoreexpf
\end{aligned}
$$
