#### Conditional odds
The **conditional odds** of an event $A$ given a condition $B$,
is the (conditional) probability that event $A$ occurs (given condition $B$),
divided by the (conditional) probability that it doesn't occur (given condition $B$).

$$\odds(B) \eqdef \frac{\Pr(A|B)}{\Pr(\neg A|B)}$${#eq-def-c-odds}

We can represent conditional odds using 
$\odds(A|B)$, $\odds(B)$ or $\odds_B$ ("omega bee").
