## Risk estimation and prediction

::: notes
In Epi 203,
you have already seen
methods for modeling binary outcomes
using one covariate that is also binary
(such as exposure/non-exposure).
In this section, we review one-covariate analyses,
with a special focus on risk ratios and odds ratios,
which are important concepts for interpreting logistic regression.
