R provides a rich ecosystem of packages for survival analysis,
ranging from core functionality to specialized visualization tools and advanced modeling capabilities.
This section provides an overview of the most commonly used and useful packages.

### Core Survival Analysis Package

**[`survival`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html)** is the foundational package for survival analysis in R.

- Maintained by Terry M. Therneau
- Provides essential functions for Kaplan-Meier estimation (`survfit()`), 
Cox proportional hazards models (`coxph()`), 
and parametric survival models (`survreg()`)
- Includes support for multi-state models, competing risks, and time-dependent covariates
- Part of the recommended packages that come with base R installations
- Most other survival analysis packages build upon or extend `survival`

### Visualization Packages

#### ggsurvfit

**[`ggsurvfit`](https://danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/)** is a modern package for creating publication-ready survival plots using ggplot2.

- Developed by [Daniel D. Sjoberg](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/) and collaborators
- Seamlessly integrates with ggplot2,
allowing full customization using familiar ggplot2 syntax
- Key features:
  - Create Kaplan-Meier plots with `ggsurvfit()`
  - Add confidence intervals with `add_confidence_interval()`
  - Add risk tables with `add_risktable()`
  - Add quantile annotations with `add_quantile()`
  - Support for competing risks with `ggcuminc()`
- Produces publication-ready legends without showing raw variable names
- All plot elements are native ggplot2 layers,
making customization straightforward
- Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggsurvfit) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/ggsurvfit)

#### survminer

**[`survminer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html)** is another popular visualization package for survival analysis.

- Creates ggplot2-based survival plots using `ggsurvplot()`
- Provides functions for visualizing Cox model results
- Includes tools for testing proportional hazards assumptions
- Offers built-in themes and color palettes for publication-quality plots
- Can display risk tables, cumulative events, and censoring counts

#### ggfortify

**[`ggfortify`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggfortify/index.html)** extends ggplot2 with automatic plotting capabilities.

- Provides `autoplot()` method for `survfit` objects
- One-line code to create survival curves with confidence intervals
- Automatically handles grouping variables and creates legends
- Shows censoring marks on plots by default
- Returns ggplot2 objects for further customization
- Also supports many other statistical objects beyond survival analysis

### Additional Modeling Packages

Several packages extend the modeling capabilities beyond the core `survival` package:

- **`flexsurv`**: Flexible parametric survival models with a wide range of distributions
- **`rms`** (Regression Modeling Strategies): 
Advanced regression modeling including survival models with tools for model validation and calibration
- **`cmprsk`**: Competing risks regression using the Fine-Gray model
- **`mstate`**: Multi-state survival models for complex event histories
- **`timereg`**: Flexible regression models for survival data,
including additive hazards models
- **`frailtypack`**: Frailty models for clustered or recurrent event data
- **`riskRegression`**: Risk prediction models and performance evaluation
- **`pec`**: Prediction error curves for survival model validation
- **`prodlim`**: Fast estimation of survival models including competing risks

### Package Selection Guidance

For most standard survival analyses:

- Use **`survival`** for core functionality (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models, parametric models)
- Choose **`ggsurvfit`** for modern,
customizable survival plots if you're familiar with ggplot2
- Consider **`survminer`** as an alternative visualization package with many built-in features
- Use **`ggfortify`** if you want quick,
automatic plots with minimal code

For specialized analyses:

- **Competing risks**: `cmprsk` or `riskRegression`
- **Multi-state models**: `mstate`
- **Flexible parametric models**: `flexsurv`
- **Clustered/recurrent events**: `frailtypack`
- **Model validation**: `rms` or `pec`
