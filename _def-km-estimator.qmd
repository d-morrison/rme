#### Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit Estimator of Survival Function

If the event times are $t_i$ with events per time of $d_i$ ($1\le i \le k$),
then the **Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit Estimator**
of the [survival function](@def-surv-fn) is:

$$\hat \surv(t) = \prod_{t_i < t} \sb{\frac{1-d_i}{Y_i}}$${#eq-km-surv-est}

where $Y_i$ is the set of observations whose time (event or censored) is
$\ge t_i$, the group at risk at time $t_i$.
