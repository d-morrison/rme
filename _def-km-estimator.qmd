#### Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit Estimator of Survival Function

If a time-to-event data set contains 
$k$ event times $t_i$, ($i \in {1:k}$),
where $n_i$ is the number of individuals at risk at time $t_i$
and $d_i$ is the the number of events at time $t_i$,
then the **Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit Estimator**
of the survival function is:
