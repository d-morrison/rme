Logistic regression is named after the (inverse) link function.
Poisson regression is named after the outcome distribution.
I think this naming convention reflects the strongest 
(most questionable assumption) in the model.
In binary data regression, 
the outcome distribution essentially *must* be Bernoulli (or Binomial),
but the link function could be logit, log, identity, probit, or something more unusual.
In count data regression,
the outcome distribution could have many different shapes,
but the link function will probably end up being log,
so that covariates have multiplicative effects on the rate.
