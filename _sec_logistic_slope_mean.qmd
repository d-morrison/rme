:::{#exr-logistic-slope}
Consider a logistic regression model with a single predictor, $X$:

$$
\ba
Y_i|X_i &\simind \Ber(\pi(X_i))
\\
\pi(x) &= \expitf{\eta(x)} = \pi(\omega(\eta(x)))
\\
\eta(x) &= \alpha + \beta x
\ea
$${#eq-unipredictor-logreg}

Find the derivative of $\pi(x) = \Expf{Y|X=x}$ with respect to $x$:

$$\derivf{\pi}{x} = ?$$

:::{#sol-logistic-slope}

By @thm-d_pi-d_eta, @lem-d_logodds-d_x, and the chain rule (@thm-chain-rule):

$$
\ba
\derivf{\prob}{x} 
&=\red{\derivf{\prob}{\logodds}} \blue{\derivf{\logodds}{x}}
\\
&= \red{\pi (1-\pi)} \blue{\beta}
\\
&= \red{\Varf{Y|X=x}} \cdot \blue{\beta}
\ea
$$

::: notes
The slope is steepest at $\pi = 0.5$, i.e., at $\eta = 0$,
which for a unipredictor model occurs at $x = -\alpha/\beta$.
The slope goes to 0 as $x$ goes to $-\infty$ or $+\infty$
(compare with @fig-expit-plot).
