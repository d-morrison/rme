$$Y_i|\vX_i \sim_{\red{\ind}} \blue{\Normal}(\orange{\mu_i}, \green{\ss})$$
$$\orange{\mu_i = \reglincomb}$$

1. $\blue{\text{Normality}}$

The model assumes that the distribution conditional on a given $X$ value is Gaussian.

2. $\orange{\text{Correct Functional Form}}$ of Conditional Mean Structure
(Linear Component)

The model assumes that the conditional means have the structure:
$$\Expp[Y|\vX = \vx] = \vx'\vb$$

3. $\green{\text{Homoskedasticity}}$

The model assumes that variance $\ss$ is constant (with respect to $\vx$).


4. $\red{\text{Independence}}$

::: notes
The model assumes that the observations are statistically independent.
