:::{#def-dot-product}
#### Dot product/linear combination/inner product
For any two real-valued vectors $\vx = (\x1n)$ and $\vy = (\y1n)$,
the **dot-product**, **linear combination**, or **inner product** 
of $\vx$ and $\vy$ is:

$$\vx \cdot \vy = \vx\' \vy \defeq \sumin x_i y_i$$

"Linear combination" can also refer to weighted sums of vectors,
or in other words matrix-vector multiplication.

The dot-product has a different generalization for two matrices;
see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Dyadics_and_matrices) for more.

#### Dot product is symmetric

The dot product is symmetric:

$$\vx \cdot \vy = \vy \cdot \vx$$

::: proof

Apply:

- @def-dot-product 
- symmetry of scalar multiplication
- @def-dot-product again
