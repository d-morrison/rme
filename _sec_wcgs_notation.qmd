For the `wgcs` dataset, let's consider a **logistic regression model** for the outcome of
Coronary Heart Disease ($Y$; `chd` in computer output):

- $Y = 1$ if an individual developed CHD by the end of the study;
- $Y = 0$ if they have not developed CHD by the end of the study.

Let's include an intercept, two covariates, plus their interaction:

* $A$: age at study enrollment (`age`, recorded in years)
* $P$: personality type (`dibpat`):
  - $P = 1$ represents "Type A personality",
  - $P = 0$ represents "Type B personality".
* $PA$: the interaction of personality type and age (`age:dibpat`)
* $\vX = (1, A, P, PA)$
