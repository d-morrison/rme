::: notes
Some scholars have raised objections to the use of odds ratios as 
an effect measurement [@sackett1996down; @norton2024requiem]. 
One objection is that odds ratios depend on the set of covariates
in a model,
even when those covariates are independent of the exposure of interest
and do not interact with that exposure.
For example, consider the following model:

:::

$$\P(Y=y|X=x,C=c) = \red{\pi(x,c)}^y (1-\red{\pi(x,c)})^{1-y}$$

$$\red{\pi(x,c)} = \expitf{\eta_0 + \b_Xx + \b_Cc}$$

Then:

$$
\ba
\Ef{Y|X=x} &= \Expf{\Ef{Y | X, C} | X=x}
\\ &= \Expf{\pi(X,C) | X=x}
\\ &= \Expf{\expitf{\eta_0 + \b_X X + \b_C C} | X=x}
\\ &= \int_c{\expitf{\eta_0 + \b_X x + \b_C c} ~\p(C=c|X=x)~ \partial c}
\\ &= \int_c{\pi(x,c)~ \p(C=c|X=x)~ \partial c}
\ea
$$

::: notes
Since the $\expitf{}$ function is nonlinear, 
we can't change the order of the expectation and $\expitf{}$ operators:
:::

$$\Expf{\expitf{\eta_0 + \b_XX + \b_CC} | X} \neq \expitf{\Expf{\eta_0 + \b_XX + \b_CC} | X}$$

---

In contrast, consider a model with an identity link function:

$$\P(Y=y|X=x,C=c) = \red{\pi(x,c)}^y (1-\red{\pi(x,c)})^{1-y}$$

$$\red{\pi(x,c)} = \eta_0 + \b_Xx + \b_Cc$$

Then:

$$
\ba
\Ef{Y|X} &= \Expf{\Ef{Y | X, C} | X}
\\ &= \Expf{\eta_0 + \b_X X + \b_C C | X=x}
\\ &= \eta_0 + \b_X X +  \red{\Expf{ \b_C C | X}}
\ea
$$

If $C \ind X$,
then:

$$\red{\Expf{ \b_CC | X}} = \b_C \Ef{C}$$

and 

$$
\ba
\Ef{Y|X} &= \red{(\eta_0 + \b_C \Ef{C})} + \blue{\b_XX}
\\ &= \red{\eta_0^*}  + \blue{\b_XX}
\ea
$$

So:

$$
\ba
\deriv{x} \Ef{Y|X=x} = \blue{\b_X x} = \deriv{x} \Ef{Y|X=x,C=c}
\ea
$$
