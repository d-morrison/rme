# Goldbach's Conjecture

{{< include latex-macros/macros.qmd >}}

## Statement of the Conjecture

**Goldbach's Conjecture** is one of the oldest and most famous unsolved problems in number theory.
It was first proposed by the German mathematician Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742.

### Strong Goldbach Conjecture

::: {#def-goldbach-strong}
#### Strong Goldbach Conjecture

Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
:::

Formally, for every even integer $n > 2$, there exist prime numbers $p$ and $q$ such that:

$$
n = p + q
$$

### Weak Goldbach Conjecture

::: {#def-goldbach-weak}
#### Weak Goldbach Conjecture

Every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers.
:::

Formally, for every odd integer $n > 5$, there exist prime numbers $p$, $q$, and $r$ such that:

$$
n = p + q + r
$$

## Historical Context

- **1742**: Christian Goldbach proposed the conjecture in a letter to Leonhard Euler
- **1937**: Ivan Vinogradov proved that every sufficiently large odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three primes,
making significant progress toward the weak conjecture
- **2013**: Harald Helfgott completed the proof of the weak Goldbach conjecture
- **Present**: The strong Goldbach conjecture remains unproven,
though it has been verified computationally for all even numbers up to extremely large values

## Examples

::: {#exm-goldbach-small}
#### Small even numbers

Here are some examples of even numbers expressed as the sum of two primes:

- $4 = 2 + 2$
- $6 = 3 + 3$
- $8 = 3 + 5$
- $10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5$
- $12 = 5 + 7$
- $14 = 3 + 11 = 7 + 7$
- $16 = 3 + 13 = 5 + 11$
- $18 = 5 + 13 = 7 + 11$
- $20 = 3 + 17 = 7 + 13$

Note that for most even numbers,
there are multiple ways to express them as the sum of two primes.

## Computational Verification

```{r}
#| label: goldbach-verification
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: show

# Note: This code prioritizes clarity and educational value over performance.
# For production use with large numbers, consider optimizations such as:
# - Sieve of Eratosthenes for generating primes
# - Pre-allocating data structures instead of using rbind()

# Function to check if a number is prime
is_prime <- function(n) {
  if (n < 2) return(FALSE)
  if (n == 2) return(TRUE)
  if (n %% 2 == 0) return(FALSE)
  if (n == 3) return(TRUE)
  
  # Check odd divisors from 3 to sqrt(n)
  i <- 3
  while (i * i <= n) {
    if (n %% i == 0) return(FALSE)
    i <- i + 2
  }
  return(TRUE)
}

# Function to find Goldbach pairs for an even number
find_goldbach_pairs <- function(n) {
  if (n <= 2 || n %% 2 != 0) {
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  pairs <- list()
  for (p in 2:(n / 2)) {
    q <- n - p
    if (is_prime(p) && is_prime(q)) {
      pairs[[length(pairs) + 1]] <- c(p, q)
    }
  }
  return(pairs)
}

# Test the conjecture for even numbers from 4 to 100
verify_goldbach <- function(max_n = 100) {
  results <- data.frame(
    n = integer(),
    num_pairs = integer(),
    first_pair = character(),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  
  for (n in seq(4, max_n, by = 2)) {
    pairs <- find_goldbach_pairs(n)
    if (length(pairs) > 0) {
      first_pair_str <- paste(pairs[[1]], collapse = " + ")
      results <- rbind(results, data.frame(
        n = n,
        num_pairs = length(pairs),
        first_pair = first_pair_str,
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE
      ))
    }
  }
  
  return(results)
}

# Verify for even numbers up to 100
goldbach_results <- verify_goldbach(100)
print(goldbach_results)
```

## Computational Evidence

The strong Goldbach conjecture has been verified computationally for all even integers up to at least $4 \times 10^{18}$ (as of 2020).
While this provides strong empirical evidence,
it does not constitute a mathematical proof.

## Current Status

- **Weak Goldbach Conjecture**: **Proven** (Harald Helfgott, 2013)
- **Strong Goldbach Conjecture**: **Unproven** (remains an open problem)

The strong Goldbach conjecture is considered one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.
Despite centuries of effort by mathematicians and extensive computational verification,
a general proof remains elusive.

## Relevance to Applied Mathematics

While Goldbach's conjecture itself is a problem in pure mathematics (number theory),
studying such problems develops important skills:

- Understanding the relationship between conjectures and proofs
- Distinguishing between empirical evidence and mathematical proof
- Working with number-theoretic concepts
- Developing computational verification methods

These skills are valuable in applied mathematics and statistics,
where we often work with theoretical results that must be verified empirically.
