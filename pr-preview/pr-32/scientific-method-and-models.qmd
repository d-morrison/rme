As scientists, we attempt to answer factual questions about the world and universe in the past, present, and/or future. 
The [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) involves:
  
* conceiving a question
* hypothesizing a specific version of that model 
* proposing a study design that would provide data relevant to the model
* analyzing the data
* estimating model parameters
* "inference":
    - quantifying uncertainty
    - drawing conclusions
