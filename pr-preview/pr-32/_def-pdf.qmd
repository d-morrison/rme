#### probability density

If $X$ is a continuous random variable, then the **probability density** of
$X$ at value $x$,
denoted $f(x)$, $f_X(x)$, $\p(x)$, $\p_X(x)$, or $\p(X=x)$,
is defined as the limit of the probability (mass) that $X$ is in an
interval around $x$,
divided by the width of that interval,
as that width reduces to 0.

$$

f(x) &\eqdef  \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}
   \frac{\P(X \in [x, x + \delta])}{\delta}
