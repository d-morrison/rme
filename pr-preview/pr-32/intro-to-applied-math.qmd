# Thoughts on studying applied math

When you encounter a new function $f(x)$, 
it's often a good idea to attempt to derive the following characteristics:

- $\log{f(x)}$

- $f'(x)$
  - (by transitivity, also compute $f''(x)$, $f'''(x)$, etc. until you can't go any further)

- $\log'(f(x)) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$

- $f^{-1}(x)$

- $1 - f(x)$

- $(f(x))^{-1}$

- $\int f(x)dx$

Check key values:

- $f(\infty)$

- $f(0)$

- $f(1)$

- $f(-\infty)$
