# Overview of Appendices

These appendices contain information that I consider to be 
important prerequisites for the main content of this course.
I will review *some* of this content in class, 
but not all of it;
there simply isn't enough time to cover it all, 
and it should be review from your earlier statistics courses.
The appendices are also not an exhaustive list 
of the assumed prerequisites.

---

Please test yourself on this material; 
try to write down the definitions from memory,
try to solve the proofs for yourself 
before looking the provided versions, 
and 
try to implement the programming solutions 
before looking at the provided code.

---

If you find that don't have all of 
the definitions and results in these appendices 
memorized yet,
now is the time to make it happen.

## Rote memorization is sometimes necessary

::: notes
For much of my K-12 education, 
I tried to avoid spending time on rote memorization.
Instead, I memorized concepts passively,
by repeatedly looking up and applying definitions 
as I solved problems.
I still think that is the most pleasant way to learn,
but when I started taking college-level quantitative courses,
I found that passive memorization was no longer sufficiently reliable.
Especially in the 10-week quarter system, 
there isn't enough time 
for new concepts to settle in naturally 
before we need to 
use those concepts and 
construct higher-level concepts on top of them.
So, if you are missing any of the concepts in these appendices,
please lock them in ASAP.
You will need them.
