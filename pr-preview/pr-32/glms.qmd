This section is primarily adapted starting from the textbook "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models" (4th edition, 2018)

The type of predictive model one uses depends on several issues; one is the type of response.

* Measured values such as quantity of a protein, age, weight usually can be handled in an ordinary linear regression model, possibly after a log transformation.

* Patient survival, which may be censored, calls for a different method (survival analysis, Cox regression).

* If the response is binary, then can we use logistic regression models

* If the response is a count, we can use Poisson regression

* If the count has a higher variance than is consistent with the Poisson, we can use a negative binomial or over-dispersed Poisson

* Other forms of response can generate other types of generalized linear models

We need a linear predictor of the same form as in linear regression $\beta x$. In theory, such a linear predictor can generate any type of number as a prediction, positive, negative, or zero

We choose a suitable distribution for the type of data we are predicting 
(normal for any number, gamma for positive numbers, binomial for binary responses, Poisson for counts)

We create a link function 
which maps the mean of the distribution 
onto the set of all possible linear prediction results, 
which is the whole real line ($-\infty, \infty$). 
The inverse of the link function takes the linear predictor to the actual prediction.

* Ordinary linear regression has identity link (no transformation by the link function) and uses the normal distribution

* If one is predicting an inherently positive quantity, one may want to use the log link since ex is always positive.

* An alternative to using a generalized linear model with a log link, is to transform the data using the log. This is a device that works well with measurement data and may be usable in other cases, but it cannot be used for 0/1 data or for count data that may be 0.
