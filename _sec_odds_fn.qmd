::: {#exr-prob-to-odds}
Find a general formula for converting probabilities into odds.
:::

---

:::{#sol-prob-to-odds}

Using @def-odds and @cor-p-neg:

$$
\ba
\odds &\eqdef \frac{\Pr(A)}{\Pr(\neg A)}
\\ &= \frac{\pi}{1-\pi}
\ea
$$

:::

:::{#thm-prob-to-odds}
If $\prob$ is the probability of an event $A$
and $\odds$ is the corresponding odds of $A$,
then:

$$\odds = \frac{\prob}{1-\prob}$${#eq-odds-prob}

:::

::: proof
By @sol-prob-to-odds.

::: notes
The mathematical relationship between odds $\odds$ and probabilities $\pi$, 
which is represented in @eq-odds-prob,
is a core component of logistic regression models,
as we see shortly.
Let's give the expression on the righthand side of @eq-odds-prob
its own name and symbol,
so that we can refer to it concisely:
:::

:::{#def-odds-fn}
#### Odds function

The **odds function** is defined as:
$$\oddsf{\pi} \eqdef \frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$$ {#eq-def-odds-fn}

:::

---

::: notes
We can use the odds function (@def-odds-fn) to simplify @eq-odds-prob from @thm-prob-to-odds into a more concise form,
which is easier to remember and manipulate:
:::

:::{#cor-oddsf-to-odds}
If $\prob$ is the probability of an outcome $A$
and $\odds$ is the corresponding odds of $A$,
then:

$$\odds = \oddsf{\prob}$${#eq-odds-odds-fn}

:::

---

::: proof

By @thm-prob-to-odds and @def-odds-fn.

:::

::: notes
In other words,
the odds function transforms probabilities into odds. 
:::

---

:::{#exr-graph-odds-fn}
Graph the odds function.
:::

:::{#sol-graph-odds-fn}

::: notes
@fig-odds-probs graphs the odds function.
