In logistic regression, we will make use of a mathematically-convenient transformation of probability, called *odds*:

#### Odds

::: notes
The **odds** of an event $A$,
is the probability that the event occurs,
divided by the probability that it doesn't occur.
We can represent odds with the Greek letter $\odds$ ("omega").
^[The name "omega" is a contraction of "o mega", 
which means "long o" in Greek,
in contrast with "omicron" ($\omicron$, "short o").
See <https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=omega>
and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega> for more details.]
Thus, in mathematical notation:
:::

$$\odds \eqdef \frac{\Pr(A)}{\Pr(\neg A)}$${#eq-def-odds}
