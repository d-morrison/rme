::: notes

Some distributions are typically used for outcome models (@tbl-outcome-distns);
other distributions are typically used for test statistics (@tbl-test-stat-distns).

:::{#tbl-outcome-distns}
Distribution | Uses
------------ | ---
Bernoulli | Binary outcomes
Binomial | Sums of Bernoulli outcomes
Poisson | unbounded count outcomes
Geometric | Counts of non-events before an event occurs
Negative binomal | Mixtures of Poisson distributions, counts of non-events until a given number of events occurs
Normal (Gaussian) | Continuous outcomes without a more specific distribution
exponential | Time to event outcomes
Gamma | Time to event outcomes
Weibull | Time to event outcomes
Log-normal | Time to event outcomes

:::{#tbl-test-stat-distns}
Distribution | Uses
------------ | ----
$\chi^2$ | Regression comparisons (asymptotic), contingency table independence tests, goodness-of-fit tests
$F$ | Gaussian model comparisons (exact)
$Z$ (standard normal) | Proportions, means, regression coefficients (asymptotic)
$T$ | Means, regression coefficients in Gaussian outcome models (exact)
