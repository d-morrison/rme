# Common Mistakes

## Parameters versus random variables

The parameters of a probability distribution shouldn't involve the random variables being modeled:

### This is wrong

$$X \sim Pois(\lambda)$$
$$\hat{\lambda}_{ML} \rightarrow_D N(\bar{X}, \lambda/n)$$
:::

::::{.solution}
$$\hat{\lambda}_{ML} \rightarrow_D N(\lambda, \lambda/n)$$
::::



Expectations are means, not sums, despite the similarity of $\Sigma$ and $\text{E}$.
Really, we should use $\mu$ instead of $\text{E}$.

## Statistical Modeling and Causal Inference

### Controlling for Colliders

A common mistake in building regression models is controlling for variables that are affected by both the exposure and outcome (colliders).
Conditioning on or selecting based on a collider can introduce bias rather than reduce it,
creating spurious associations or masking true relationships.

For example,
restricting an analysis to hospitalized patients when studying the relationship between two diseases can create false associations,
because hospitalization is influenced by both diseases.

See @sec-collider-bias for detailed discussion of collider bias and how to avoid it.

## Key Principle

Not every variable should be included as a covariate in a regression model.
Subject matter knowledge and causal reasoning should guide variable selection,
not just statistical significance or model fit criteria.

## R

### Don't copy-paste code

Successful programmers don't use copy-paste! [Write functions instead.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions#introduction)

## Quarto

### Separate divs and slide breaks

Make sure not to put a div `:::` on the next line after a slide break `---`:

```
---
::: notes
:::
```

There needs to be an empty line between them:

```

::: notes
:::
```

### `library(printr)` currently breaks `df-print: paged`

See <https://github.com/yihui/printr/issues/41>

## LaTeX

- don't use `align*` or `align*` in quarto; only `aligned`
