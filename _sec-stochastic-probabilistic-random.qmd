The terms "stochastic", "probabilistic", and "random" are frequently used in statistics and probability theory,
often interchangeably in everyday conversation,
but they carry nuanced technical distinctions.

### Key distinction: modeling approach vs. phenomena

As noted in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic):

> _Stochasticity_ and _randomness_ are technically distinct concepts:
> the former refers to a modeling approach,
> while the latter describes phenomena;
> in everyday conversation these terms are often used interchangeably.

### Definitions

**Random** describes something that occurs by chance,
without a deterministic pattern.
It is the most general term,
used to describe variables or occurrences whose outcome cannot be predicted precisely,
only probabilistically.
For example,
we speak of "random variables" and "random events".

**Stochastic** comes from the Greek "στόχος" (_stókhos_),
meaning "aim" or "guess"
(see [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=stochastic)).
In mathematics,
a **stochastic process** is formally defined as a collection of random variables indexed by time or space.
The term is almost always used in the context of processes or systems evolving in time or space under uncertain rules.
Note that in probability theory,
"stochastic process" and "random process" are synonyms
[@Adler2009random; @Stirzaker2005probability; @Kallenberg2002foundations].

**Probabilistic** refers to any model,
reasoning,
or method that explicitly involves probability theory.
Probabilistic models assign probabilities to events or outcomes;
they focus on quantifying and reasoning about uncertainty based on known or estimated distributions.
While all stochastic models are probabilistic (since they use probabilities),
not all probabilistic models need to describe processes evolving in time.

: Comparison of "random", "stochastic", and "probabilistic" {#tbl-random-stochastic-probabilistic}

While some sources treat "stochastic" and "random" as practically synonymous,
the academic preference is to use "random" for variables and events,
and "stochastic" for processes,
especially to highlight temporal or spatial structure in the modeling.
