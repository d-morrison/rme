## Introduction to classification {#sec-classification}

Classification is a fundamental concept in epidemiology and diagnostic medicine, where we need to determine whether an individual has a particular disease or condition based on test results or other indicators. Understanding how to interpret diagnostic tests requires knowledge of key statistical concepts including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.

In this section, we explore how Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability that a person has a disease given a positive test result. This is particularly important in public health decision-making, where we must understand not just how accurate a test is in general, but how to interpret test results for individuals in specific populations.

### Diagnostic test characteristics

When evaluating a diagnostic test, we consider several key performance measures:

- **Sensitivity**: The probability that the test is positive given that the person has the disease, denoted $\Pr(\text{positive} \mid \text{disease})$
- **Specificity**: The probability that the test is negative given that the person does not have the disease, denoted $\Pr(\text{negative} \mid \text{no disease})$
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: The probability that a person has the disease given that their test is positive, denoted $\Pr(\text{disease} \mid \text{positive})$
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: The probability that a person does not have the disease given that their test is negative, denoted $\Pr(\text{no disease} \mid \text{negative})$

### Example: COVID-19 testing

Suppose we have a COVID-19 test with the following characteristics:

- **99% sensitive**: If a person has COVID-19, the test will be positive 99% of the time
- **99% specific**: If a person does not have COVID-19, the test will be negative 99% of the time

Let's define our events:

- Let $D$ denote the event "person has COVID-19"
- Let $+$ denote the event "test is positive"

Then our test characteristics can be written as:

$$
\Pr(+ \mid D) = 0.99 \quad \text{(sensitivity)}
$$

$$
\Pr(- \mid \neg D) = 0.99 \quad \text{(specificity)}
$$

Note that if specificity is 0.99, then the false positive rate is:
$$
\Pr(+ \mid \neg D) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01
$$

Suppose the **prevalence** of COVID-19 in the population is 7%:

$$
\Pr(D) = 0.07
$$

$$
\Pr(\neg D) = 0.93
$$

### Calculating positive predictive value

The key question we want to answer is: **If someone tests positive, what is the probability they actually have COVID-19?**

This is the positive predictive value:
$$
\Pr(D \mid +) = \, ?
$$

We can use **Bayes' theorem** to calculate this:

$$
\Pr(D \mid +) = \frac{\Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D)}{\Pr(+)}
$$

To find $\Pr(+)$, we use the **law of total probability**:

$$
\Pr(+) = \Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D) + \Pr(+ \mid \neg D) \cdot \Pr(\neg D)
$$

Now we can calculate each component:

**Probability of being positive with disease:**
$$
\Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D) = 0.99 \times 0.07 = 0.0693
$$

**Probability of being positive without disease (false positive):**
$$
\Pr(+ \mid \neg D) \cdot \Pr(\neg D) = 0.01 \times 0.93 = 0.0093
$$

**Total probability of positive test:**
$$
\Pr(+) = 0.0693 + 0.0093 = 0.0786
$$

**Positive predictive value:**
$$
\Pr(D \mid +) = \frac{0.0693}{0.0786} = 0.88
$$

Therefore, even with a highly accurate test (99% sensitive and 99% specific), only about 88% of people who test positive actually have COVID-19. This is because the disease prevalence is relatively low (7%), so false positives make up a meaningful fraction of all positive tests.

### Alternative formulation

We can rearrange Bayes' theorem to express the positive predictive value in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence:

$$
\begin{align}
\Pr(D \mid +) &= \frac{\Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D)}{\Pr(+)} \\
&= \frac{\Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D)}{\Pr(+ \mid D) \cdot \Pr(D) + \Pr(+ \mid \neg D) \cdot \Pr(\neg D)} \\
&= \frac{\Pr(D)}{\Pr(D) + \frac{\Pr(+ \mid \neg D)}{\Pr(+ \mid D)} \cdot \Pr(\neg D)} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\Pr(+ \mid \neg D)}{\Pr(+ \mid D)} \cdot \frac{\Pr(\neg D)}{\Pr(D)}}
\end{align}
$$

This final form emphasizes the ratio of the false positive rate to the sensitivity, weighted by the ratio of non-diseased to diseased individuals in the population. It shows that even with a very high sensitivity and specificity, the positive predictive value depends strongly on disease prevalence.
