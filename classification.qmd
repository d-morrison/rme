## Introduction to classification {#sec-classification}

### Positive predictive value

Suppose a test is 99% sensitive, 99% specific;

99% Sensitive means if the person has disease, the test is positive, 99% of
the time:

$$\pmf{ + | D} = .99$$

99% specific means if they don't have covid, the test says no covid, 99%
of the time:

7% of people actually have covid: 

$$\mass(A) = 0.07$$ 

$$\mass(\neg A) = .93$$



$p\left( negative \middle| no\ covid \right) = .99$:
$p\left( B \middle| !A \right)$

$$p\left( Covid \middle| positive \right) = ?$$

$$p\left( A \middle| B \right) = \frac{p\left( B \middle| A \right)p(A)}{p(B)}$$

$$p(B) = p\left( B \middle| A \right)p(A) + p\left( B \middle| !A \right)p(!A)$$

$$p\left( B \middle| A \right)p(A) = .99*\ .07 = .0693$$

$$\ p\left( B \middle| !A \right)p(!A) = .01*.93 = .0093$$

$$p(B) = .0693 + .0093 = .0786$$

$$p\left( A \middle| B \right) = .0693/.0786$$

$$= .88$$

$${p\left( A \middle| B \right) = \frac{p\left( B \middle| A \right)p(A)}{p(B)}
}{= p\left( B \middle| A \right)\frac{p(A)}{p(B)}
}{= p\left( B \middle| A \right)\frac{p(A)}{p\left( B \middle| A \right)p(A) + p\left( B \middle| !A \right)p(!A)}}$$

$$= \frac{p(A)}{p(A) + \frac{p\left( B \middle| !A \right)}{p\left( B \middle| A \right)}p(!A)}$$

$$= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{p\left( B \middle| !A \right)}{p\left( B \middle| A \right)}\frac{p(!A)}{p(A)}}
$$
