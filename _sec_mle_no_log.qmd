To find the maximizer(s) of the likelihood function,
we need to solve $\Lik'(\th) = 0$ for $\theta$.
However, even for mutually independent data, we quickly run into a problem:

$$
\ba
\Lik'(\th)
&= \deriv{\th} \Lik(\th)
\\ &= \deriv{\th} \prod_{i=1}^n p(X_i=x_i|\theta)
\ea
$$ {#eq-deriv-Lik}

The derivative of the likelihood of independent data is
the derivative of a product.
To evaluate this derivative,
we will have to perform a massive application of
the product rule (@thm-product-rule).
