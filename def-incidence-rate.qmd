#### Incidence rate

Given a population of $N$ individuals indexed by $i$, 
each with their own hazard rate $\haz_i(t)$, 
the **incidence rate** for that population is the mean hazard rate:

$$\incidence(t) \eqdef \frac{1}{N}\sumiN \haz_i(t)$$

#### Incidence rate in a homogenous population

If a population of individuals indexed by $i$ 
all have identical hazard rates $\haz_i(t) = \haz(t)$, 
then the **incidence rate** for that population 
is equal to the hazard rate:

$$\incidence(t) = \haz(t)$$
