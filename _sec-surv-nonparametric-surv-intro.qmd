### Basic ideas

-   Mostly, we work without a parametric model.

-   The first task is to estimate a survival function from data listing
survival times, and censoring times for censored data.

-   For example one patient may have relapsed at 10 months. Another
might have been followed for 32 months without a relapse having
occurred (censored).

-   The minimum information we need for each patient is a time and a
censoring variable which is 1 if the event occurred at the indicated
time and 0 if this is a censoring time.
