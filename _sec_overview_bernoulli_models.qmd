**Logistic regression** is a framework for modeling [binary](probability.qmd#def-binary) outcomes, conditional on one or more *predictors* (a.k.a. *covariates*).

Logistic regression uses the [Bernoulli](probability.qmd#def-bernoulli) distribution to model the outcome variable, conditional on one or more covariates.

### Logistic regression versus linear regression

Logistic regression differs from linear regression, which uses the Gaussian ("normal") distribution to model the outcome variable, conditional on the covariates.

Recall: what kinds of outcomes is linear regression used for?
::::

---

::: {#sol-examples-linreg}

Linear regression is typically used for numerical outcomes that aren't event counts or waiting times for an event.

Examples of outcomes that are often analyzed using linear regression include:

- weight
- height
- income
- prices
