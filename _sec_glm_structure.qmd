1.   The **outcome distribution** family
(a.k.a. the **random component** of the model)

* Gaussian (normal)
* Binomial
* Poisson
* Exponential
* Gamma
* Negative binomial

---

2.   The **linear component**
(a.k.a. the *linear predictor* or *linear functional form*)
describing how the covariates combine to define subpopulations:

$$\eta(\vx) \eqdef \vx \' \vb = \b_0 + \b_1 x_1 + \b_2 x_2 + ...$$

---

3.  The **link function** relating the outcome distribution
to the linear component, typically through the mean:

* identity: $\mu(y) = \eta(\vx)$
* logit: $\logf{\frac{\mu(y)}{1-\mu(y)}} = \eta(\vx)$
* log: $\logf{\mu(y)} = \eta(\vx)$
* inverse: $\invf{\mu(y)} = \eta(\vx)$
* clog-log: $\logf{-\logf{1-\mu(y)}} = \eta(\vx)$

Components 2 and 3 together are sometimes called
the **systematic component** of the model
(for example, in @dunn2018generalized).
