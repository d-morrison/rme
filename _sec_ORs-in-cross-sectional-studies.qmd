* If a cross-sectional study is a uniform probability sample of a population
(which it rarely is),
then we can estimate prevalence 
(sometimes called "prevalence risk" or just "risk") 
as well as prevalence differences and prevalence ratios comparing sub-populations,
using standard methods [@LEEJAMES1994ORoR].

* If the cross-sectional study is a stratified probability sample, 
then we can estimate prevalences and prevalence ratios
using specialized methods for complex surveys [@lumleyComplexSurveys2010].

* If the study has sampling biases that we cannot adjust for with survey weights, 
such as in a convenience sample,
then we need to treat it in the same way as a case-control study.

* We can validly estimate prevalence odds ratios in either case.

* But we cannot always validly estimate prevalences and prevalence ratios.
