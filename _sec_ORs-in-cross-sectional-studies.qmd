* If a cross-sectional study is a uniform probability sample of a population
(which it rarely is),
then we can estimate *prevalence risks* and *prevalence risk ratios*
for the variables measured in the study using standard methods
[@LEEJAMES1994ORoR].

* If the cross-sectional study is a stratified survey sample, 
then we can estimate prevalence risks and prevalence risk ratios
using specialized methods for complex surveys [@lumleyComplexSurveys2010].

* If the study is has sampling biases that we cannot adjust for with survey weights, 
such as in a convenience sample,
then we need to treat it in the same way as a case-control study.

* We can validly estimate odds ratios in either case.

* But we can not always validly estimate prevalences and prevalence ratios.
