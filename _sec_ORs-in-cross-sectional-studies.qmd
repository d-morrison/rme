* If a cross-sectional study is a uniform probability sample of a population
(which it rarely is),
then we can estimate prevalence 
(sometimes called "prevalence risk" or just "risk")
using standard methods [@LEEJAMES1994ORoR],
and we can thus also estimate 
prevalence differences, 
prevalence ratios, 
and prevalence odds ratios comparing sub-populations.

* If the cross-sectional study is a stratified probability sample, 
then we can estimate 
prevalence, 
prevalence differences,
prevalence ratios,
and prevalence odds ratios
using specialized methods for complex surveys [@lumleyComplexSurveys2010].

* If the study has sampling biases that we cannot adjust for with survey weights, 
such as in a convenience sample,
then we need to treat it in the same way as a case-control study,
and we cannot validly estimate 
prevalence, 
prevalence differences, 
or prevalence ratios;
we can only validly estimate prevalence *odds* ratios.
