* If a cross-sectional study is a probability sample of a population (which it rarely is), 
then we can estimate prevalence, 
either in the whole population or in subpopulations defined by covariates.

* If it is a sample, but not an unbiased probability sample, 
then we need to treat it in the same way as a case-control study.

* We can validly estimate odds ratios in either case.

* But we can usually not validly estimate prevalences and prevalence ratios.
