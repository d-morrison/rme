The first derivative^[a.k.a. the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient)] of the log-likelihood, $\lik'(\th)$, is important enough to have its own name: the *score function*.

::: notes
We often
skip writing the arguments $x$ and/or $\theta)$, so
$\ell' \eqdef \ell'(\vec x;\theta) \eqdef \ell'(\theta)$.[^2]
Some statisticians
use $U$ or $S$ instead of $\ell'$.
I prefer $\ell'$.
Why use up extra letters?
