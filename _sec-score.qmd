The first derivative^[a.k.a. the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient)] of the log-likelihood, $\lik'(\th)$, is important enough to have its own name: the *score function*.

{{< include _def_score.qmd >}}

::: notes
We often
skip writing the arguments $x$ and/or $\theta)$, so
$\ell' \eqdef \ell'(\vec x | \theta) \eqdef \ell'(\theta)$.

Some statisticians
use $U$ or $S$ instead of $\ell'$.
We will use $\ell'$,
both to save $U$ and $S$ for other uses
and to avoid introducing unnecessary notation to memorize.

::: callout-note

In all four cases above,
the score function (with respect to the mean)
turned out to be $$\scoreexpf$$.
That is no coincidence.
All four of these distributions 
belong to the 
[exponential family/class of probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family).
The distributions in the exponential family share many special properties.
