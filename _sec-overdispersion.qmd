::: notes

The Poisson distribution model **forces** the variance to equal the mean.
In practice, many count distributions will have a variance substantially larger than the mean (or occasionally, smaller).

#### Overdispersion

A random variable $X$ is **overdispersed**
relative to a model $\p(X=x)$ if
if its empirical variance in a dataset is larger than
the value is predicted by the fitted model $\hat{\p}(X=x)$.

When we encounter overdispersion,
we can try to reduce the residual variance
by adding more covariates.
